SolrSherlock
============
Last edit: 20131125

The core SolrSherlock project, which consists of many sub-projects

Added the directory /masterlib which exists to collect all library files for each project; this will not be needed after we mavenize everything, but for now, it is reasonable to swap a **dependency.txt** file for all the jar files in each projects /lib directory. If this project is loaded into an IDE (e.g. eclipse), then these jar files can be used in each project.

We are starting to collect documents in the /docs directory.
